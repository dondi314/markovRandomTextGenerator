You are in your dorm room. Your roommate is playing Jello
Biafra. The cups on the desk are shattering. 
There is an unfinished lab book here. 
There is a chemistry book here. 
There are socks here. 
There are empty beer bottles here. 
There is a computer here.
There are six moldy bananas here.
There are several tons of dirty laundry here. 
There are shattering cups here. 
There is a refrigerator here.
There is a desk with drawers here.
  Your roommate makes discouraged sounds. The cups stop shattering.
It is very heavy. You are carrying too much.

 You come to a lounge. 
  There is a door here.
  There are two chairs here.
  There is a desk here. 
  Tony is here, studying chemistry.


You start scribbling the solutions to the problems on the blank
papers of zig-zag. Just as you write the last answer, the teacher
collects the exams, staples them together, and leaves. You have
truly smoked this test.

You stumble down the hallway in a northerly direction. Smacking
into the door at the end and popping it open. You trip over your
untied shoelaces and fall through the doorway. The door slams shut
behind you. 


As you inhale the xeroxed papyrus, you feel the knowledge of the
ancients seeping into your mind. You come to a complete
understanding of the material, but you no longer have anything to
turn in.
