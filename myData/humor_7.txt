Pat was a pretty brunette with a knack for brassy banter
and a willing smile that could brighten twilight into day without a crease.

  But she was so lonely.

  Jim was a placid plainsman with a plaintive drawl that belied his firm
convictions, and a gut tough enough to bend a blade back on its kerf.

  He was lonely, too.

  The trouble with Pat and Jim, so perfectly matched, was a simple matter of
time and place.  She was a generation younger than Jim. Jim lived thousands of
miles from Pat.

  She was poor. He was rich.

  He was dumb. She was smart.

  She belonged to Mensa. He could hardly read his own signature.

  They didn't know each other or, had they known of one another, want to.

  Their destinies were not on a collision course.

  What a shame!  Their love affair would have made a great story.
