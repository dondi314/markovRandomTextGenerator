     The world is disgracefully managed; one hardly knows to whom to
     complain.
     
     Them that has, gets.
     
     There are no moral messages in Nature.
     
     There are only four basic plots in life, and nine in literature.
     
     There are those who make things happen.
     There are those who watch things happen.
     And there are those who wonder what happened.
     
     There are three rules for successfully managing people:
     Unfortunately, no one knows what they are.
     
     There are three types of deliberate falsehoods: lies, damned lies, and
     salesmen's promises.
     
     There are two kinds of men who never amount to much: those who cannot
     do what they are told, and those who can do nothing else.
     
     There are two periods in which Congress does no business: one is
     before the holidays and the other is after.
     
     There is a time for everything.
     Mostly, the wrong time.
     
     There is always one more son of a bitch than you counted on.
     
     There is an optimal size for any project, and it is always bigger than
     you can afford.
     
     There is no truth in the rumor that man is immortal.
     
     There is nothing like a grievance to sharpen an old man's wits.
     
     There is nothing more terrible than ignorance in action.
     
     There is nothing wrong with you that an expensive surgical operation
     cannot prolong.
     
     There is wisdom in madness and strong probability of truth in all
     accusations, for people are complete, and everybody is capable of
     anything.
     
     There's nothing wrong with gluttony providing you don't overdo it.
     
     These days, an education is essential for career success. Unless, of
     course, you run for Congress.
     
     They don't invite you to the White House for a drink because they
     think you are thirsty.
     
     Things get worse under pressure.
     
     Those things are better which are perfected by Nature than those which
     are finished by art.
     
     Those who beat their swords into plowshares generally end up plowing
     for those who didn't.
     
     Those who can, they do.
     Those who can't, they teach.
     Those totally devoid of useful ability become government economists.
     
     Those who can't teach, they administer.
     Those who can't administer, they run for public office.
     
     Those who do not follow are dragged.
     
     Those who do not learn from history often end up making it.
     
     Those who like sausage or political policy should not watch either
     being made.
     
     Time is a great teacher, but it kills all its pupils.
     
     To a little fish, the waters are always deep.
     
     To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.
     
     To a weary horse, even his own tail is a burden.
     
     To err is human. To really foul things up requires a computer. To
     create utter chaos with no perceivable possibility of salvation calls
     for an MBA.
     
     To have honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey the sauce to
     sugar.
     
     To hear tell a hundred times is not as good as once seeing.
     
     To spot the true expert, pick the one who predicts the job will take
     the longest and cost the most.
     
     To understand the clay is not to understand the pot.
     
     Today's conservative is yesterday's liberal who got mugged last
     night.
     
     Too much of anything is wonderful.
     
     Truth is a hard master to serve, for the more devotedly you serve her,
     the more she hurts you.
     
     Truth is very precious, so salesmen and politicians use it very
     sparingly.
     
     Tyranny is always better organized than freedom is.
     
     Under some conditions, in some place, at some time, there will always
     be at least one law, ordinance, or statute under which you can be
     booked.
     
     Under the most rigorously controlled conditions of temperature,
     pressure, humidity, time, and voltage, the machine will do as it
     damned well pleases.
     
     Unfaithfulness in the keeping of an appointment is an act of clear
     dishonesty.
     
     You may as well take a person's money as his time.
     
     Universities are full of knowledge. The freshmen bring a little in and
     the seniors take none away, so knowledge accumulates.
     
     Virtue does not lend itself to the same verbal enthusiasms that vice

"You know, once in a while it is my pleasure, and my privilege to welcome
here at the Refreshment Room some of the truly great international
artists our time.  And tonight we have one such artist.  Ladies and
gentlemen, someone who I've always personally admired, perhaps
more deeply, more strongly, and more abjectly than any other performer.
A man, well, more than a man, a god!  A great god, whose personality
is so totally and utterly wonderful, that my feeble words of welcome
sound wretchedly and pathetically inadequate.  Someone whose boots I
would gladly lick clean, until holes wore through my tongue!  A man
who is so totally and utterly wonderful, that I would rather be sealed
in a pit of my own filth than dare tread on the same stage with him!
Ladies and Gentlemen, the incomparably superior human being, Harry Fink!"

You can't change the past so no regrets.

Always keep your clothes and weapons where you can find them in
the dark.

If everything seems to be going right, you obviously don't know
what the hell is going on.

In a battle where there is no way out, take an honor guard with
you to hell.

Life's a bitch, then you die.

Life's a bitch, but death is no picnic either.

Life's a bitch, to prepare you for what comes next.

Death before dishonor.

Always take the initiative.

Get your first shot off fast. This upsets him enough that you can
make your second shot perfect.

Take out the officers early. This disrupts an organized fighting
force. If the force isn't organized, you don't have a problem.

The end justifies the means.

Death is inevitable. Go down fighting.

There is no conclusive evidence of life after death. Conversely
there is no evidence of any sort against it. Soon enough you will
know. So why worry?

The easiest means of suicide is not using your weapons.

Might is right, but guile lets you live longer.

Kill them all and let God sort them out.

Anarchy Now!

The most preposterous notion that man has ever come up with is that
The omnipotent, omniscient, benevolent Lord God of Creation, Shaper
and Ruler of all the Universes, wants worship and becomes petulant
if he does not receive it. Yet this idea, without one shred of
evidence, has paid all the expenses of the largest and least
productive industry in all history.

The second most preposterous notion is that copulation is
inherently sinful.

Always pack your own parachute.

Don't turn your back on anybody, especially your in laws.

Never sit with your back to a door.

Always expect the unexpected, especially when you don't expect it.

The only sure thing is change.

Always have at least two backup escape routes.

Do unto others before they do unto you.
Do unto others what they would do unto you but do it
first.
Do unto others what they have done unto you.

Do whatever you want, but don't get caught doing it.

I told Orville and I'm telling you, Wilbur, that danged contraption
will never work.

Do unto others then run like hell.

Always try anything, except suicide, once. Twice if you like it,
and three times to be sure.

Organized religion always has three main objectives. To benefit
the priests. To benefit the government. To always benefit

Working because you want to is the best kind of playing.

Pay taxes greater than your apparent standard of living and declare
income accordingly.

Study what the most respected authorities agree cannot be done, then do the opposite!

No born leader seeks command.

A commanding officer commands, he doesn't ask for votes.

Never appeal to man's "better nature". He may not have one.
Invoking his self interest gives you more leverage.

A competent and self confident person is incapable of jealousy in
anything. Jealousy is invariably a symptom of neurotic insecurity.

Find out what he wants, he'll geek!.

I volunteered once and that's enough for a lifetime.

There are only four top subjects, the rest are sideshows, money,
sex, war, and death. So which one do we choose? Right!

Heaven is as close as you will let it be.

To catch a thief, you set a thief free.

Can you cite one case in which a killer committed another murder
after he was executed?

When they're big enough, they're old enough and nothing can be done
about it.


Death is an old friend, I know him well. I lived with him, I ate
with him, I slept with him. To meet him again does not frighten me.
Death is as necessary as birth, and as happy in its own way.

Never tell the truth in mixed company.

Fiction is anything that has not necessarily happened yet.

Pat was a pretty brunette with a knack for brassy banter
and a willing smile that could brighten twilight into day without a crease.

  But she was so lonely.

  Jim was a placid plainsman with a plaintive drawl that belied his firm
convictions, and a gut tough enough to bend a blade back on its kerf.

  He was lonely, too.

  The trouble with Pat and Jim, so perfectly matched, was a simple matter of
time and place.  She was a generation younger than Jim. Jim lived thousands of
miles from Pat.

  She was poor. He was rich.

  He was dumb. She was smart.

  She belonged to Mensa. He could hardly read his own signature.

  They didn't know each other or, had they known of one another, want to.

  Their destinies were not on a collision course.

  What a shame!  Their love affair would have made a great story.





First of all, let me start by giving you a brief description of road
pizza for easy identification.  Have you ever been traveling down the road,
and seen a dead creature flattened onto the pavement?  This is your basic
road pizza.  This pizza may take many shapes, scents, and sizes which we
will describe in this file.

Road pizza is defined as any living creature, including little brothers, alive
at one time or another which has been flattened in various ways by a moving
vehicle, to a pizza thickness.

Now we will go into more detail on the specific types of road pizzas we
have found.

The friendly road pizza.  This pizza is created when you accidentally or
   purposely run over your neighbors pet.

Road pizza strip style is created when your neighbors cat seeks warmth on
   your car engine.  When the ignition is turned, you will in most cases have
   the genuine strip style pizza.

The unclaimed road pizza.  When a line of cars strikes the creature and no
   one wishes to claim the kill, or stops to pick it up, leaving it for the
   next passing road pizza fanatic.

The extra sauce road pizza.  Usually of the freshest variety.  Commonly
   occurs upon the creatures first day as a new road pizza member.

The pepperoni and cheese road pizza.  A favorite of road pizza fanatics.  This is a
fairly rare occurrence when the head of the creature is crushed in such a way
that it's eyes are flattened and the brains emerge from the skull giving the
pepperoni and cheese effect.

The freeze dried road pizza.  This is the standard pie, lowered below 32
degrees, creating an almost unbreakable pizza.  This particular pizza is
also one of the frisbee variety described later in this file.  Unfortunately
this one is usually only found in the northern states.

The aged road pizza.  This is the road pizza which is stuck securely to the gray
forming board.  Normally this pie has no scent, or sauce and carries a 
peculiar after taste.

The frisbee road pizza is a modified version of the aged road pizza or the freeze dried
road pizza.  With the correct size, shape, and weight this pizza may be ideal for a
good game of frisbee.

The imaginary road pizza.  This is the road pizza you thought you saw, but turns
out to be a shadow, pothole, or any other drug induced hallucination.

Multiple road pizza is created when an unfriendly scavenger is feasting on 
your road pizza.  Striking the scavenger while in this situation will create a most
delightful pie.

The intoxicated road pizza occurs while driving intoxicated and you
swerve to strike the creature, unsure of the job you did you must apply the
brakes and check your rear view mirror.  The reverse option may be necessary
at this time.

The doggie bag road pizza.  The road pizza you strike, but do not feel
like eating at the time.  This pizza may be stored in a doggie bag to keep
it fresh for later reheating.  We suggest the use of a microwave over the
conventional oven.  A delightful surprise and a nice change from the routine
meals for the wife and kids.

The smart ass road pizza.  This is the creature which nimbly jumps out
of your way, seemingly laughing at you to be struck by a car coming from the
opposite direction.

The bite size road pizzas - Includes Frogs, mice, and other small 
creatures which may be cooked later or eaten raw on the spot if still warm.

The grilled road pizza refers to birds of any type which did not
quite escape, but instead were the proper height to be mashed into your cars
grill.

The half road pizza occurs when you arrive at the sight to find only half of a
pie.  Either a generous road pizza lover was not hungry enough to eat the whole pie
or the other half is still stuck to the road pizza makers tire or wheel well.

The convulsive road pizza occurs when you strike the specimen only
injuring it and the reverse mode option of your vehicle is needed to finish
the job.

The accidental road pizza occurs when you have a healthy supply of road pizza's and
wish to leave this kill for someone else, but accidentally you skid over the
specimen instead. Sometimes this causes the extra sauce road pizza to occur.

The expensive road pizza.  This is the pizza which does more damage to
your car than you invoke on it.  Often intentional.

The reaking road pizza occurs when you strike a skunk, creating a vile
odor to take place.  Also, this road pizza has a different type of aftertaste.

Utensils needed for the road pizza epicure.

A standard spatula.
A properly warmed car engine for sufficient heating.
A strong stomach.



A place to vomit.
Dental floss for the fury road pizza's.
A can of any strong air freshener in case of the reaking road pizza encounter.


Well, this concluded this file on various road pizzas.  Hope you enjoyed
reading this information.  But back to all seriousness, we urge you to try
kitty litter.

Thanks for your time.

                     In the Beginning there was the plan.

                        And then came the assumptions.

                    And the assumptions were without form.

                And the plan was completely without substance.

              And the darkness was upon the face of the workers.

                   And they Spoke among themselves saying,

                  it is a crock of shit, and it smells funny.

           And the workers went unto their supervisors and said,

         it is a pail of dung and none may abide the odor there of.

      And the supervisors went unto their managers and said unto them,

            it is a container of excrement and it is very strong,

                       such that none may abide by it.

            And the managers went unto their directors and said,

       it is a vessel of fertilizer, and none may abide its strength.

      And the directors spoke amongst themselves, saying one to another,

      it contains that which aids plant growth, and it is very strong.

    And the directors went unto the vice presidents and said unto them,

                  it promotes growth and is very powerful.

     And the vice presidents went unto the president and said unto him,

    this new plan will actively promote the growth and efficiency of this 

                   company, and these areas in particular.

                    And the president looked upon the plan

            and saw that it was good.  And the plan became policy.

truly smoked this test.

into the door at the end and popping it open. You trip over your

behind you.
