# Textfiles used for generating random sentences

### The textfiles found here have been cleaned from http://www.textfiles.com

The main objective was to find text that was good for producing random sentences of length small enough to fit on twitter.  Basically I wanted it to spout out funny sayings, or philosophical sounding qoutes.  The humor and qoutes section of textfiles.com were good for this.  My file is rather small, and it took several hours to clean.  The reason for this is that the textfiles on this website are very unclean.  My algorithm does not simply convert uppercase to lowercase, because I want it to take into account people's name, and letters that begin a sentence.  A lot of the cleaning was too specific to do in python, and I just used my macbook's find and replace option.  Sometimes I rewrote a sentence to avoid the characters :, ;, and - whenever possible.

### What is important whenever cleaning the text?




### What are some improvemnt's to be made?
