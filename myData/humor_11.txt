                     In the Beginning there was the plan.

                        And then came the assumptions.

                    And the assumptions were without form.

                And the plan was completely without substance.

              And the darkness was upon the face of the workers.

                   And they Spoke among themselves saying,

                  it is a crock of shit, and it smells funny.

           And the workers went unto their supervisors and said,

         it is a pail of dung and none may abide the odor there of.

      And the supervisors went unto their managers and said unto them,

            it is a container of excrement and it is very strong,

                       such that none may abide by it.

            And the managers went unto their directors and said,

       it is a vessel of fertilizer, and none may abide its strength.

      And the directors spoke amongst themselves, saying one to another,

      it contains that which aids plant growth, and it is very strong.

    And the directors went unto the vice presidents and said unto them,

                  it promotes growth and is very powerful.

     And the vice presidents went unto the president and said unto him,

    this new plan will actively promote the growth and efficiency of this 

                   company, and these areas in particular.

                    And the president looked upon the plan

            and saw that it was good.  And the plan became policy.



                          This is how shit happens.
