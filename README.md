# markovRandomTextGenerator


### markovRandomTextGenerator.hs

I am learning how to program in haskell, so I decided to implement a random text generator in haskell.  This program is much slower than the one I made in python, and I have not implemented any of the nltk sorts of features in this program.

### twitter_bot.py

This program will automatically post tweets for you at set intervals of time.
